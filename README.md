To use these projects, either place the ROM file for the game in the project folder with the name `sadv.gba`/`sadv2.gba`/`sadv3.gba`, or create a `romfile.txt` file containing the path to the ROM file (without quotes). Only US ROM files are supported presently.

Currently the projects will only display the foreground and background layers. Only the foreground layers can be edited, and cannot be resized.
